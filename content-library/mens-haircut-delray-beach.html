                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Let's be honest: most guys have had that experience. You walk into a barbershop or salon, sit down, explain what you want, and walk out with something that's... close, but not quite right. Maybe the fade isn't clean. Maybe the proportions are off for your face shape. Maybe it just doesn't look like what you envisioned.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    In Delray Beach, you have plenty of options for men's haircuts. Large salons like <strong>Rové Hair Salon</strong> (5.0★, 1500+ reviews) offer volume and availability. <strong>Salon Sora</strong> (4.9★, 400+ reviews) provides a full-service experience. But here's what we've learned from hundreds of male clients over the years: the best haircut isn't just about scissors and clippers—it's about understanding your lifestyle, your hair type, and your personal style.

                            Timeless, professional, versatile. This is the cut for men who need to look polished in the boardroom and relaxed at the beach club. We're talking tapered sides, structured top, clean neckline. It works with natural texture or can be styled sleek.

                            High, mid, or low—fades are the cornerstone of contemporary men's grooming. The key is precision: the gradient should be seamless, the lines sharp, the blend invisible. A proper fade takes skill and can't be rushed.

                            Embracing natural texture with strategic layering, this style works especially well in Florida's humidity. It's low-maintenance but looks intentionally styled. Perfect for guys who don't want to spend 20 minutes on their hair every morning.

                            Not all buzz cuts are created equal. A precision buzz involves careful attention to head shape, using different guard lengths to create subtle contouring. It's masculine, confident, and requires almost zero maintenance.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Here's something most barbershops won't take time to discuss: your face shape dramatically impacts what haircut will look best. This is where consultation matters.
                </p>

                            You're lucky—almost any style works. Can go longer on top, experiment with texture, or keep it clean and classic.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

                            Strong jawline benefits from softness on top. Textured crops, side parts, or slightly longer styles balance angular features.

                            Add height on top to elongate. Fades on the sides with volume up top create the illusion of length. Avoid too much width.
                        </p>

                            Keep proportions balanced with medium length on top and fuller sides. Avoid extreme height or very short sides.

                            Going gray is natural. How you handle it is a choice. We offer subtle color services that don't look "dyed"—just gradually reduce gray to your desired level. No one needs to know you're getting color; they'll just think you look younger.

                            This is old-school grooming at its finest. Hot towels open pores, pre-shave oil protects skin, and a straight razor delivers the closest shave you've ever experienced. It's not quick, but it's an experience worth having.

                            <strong>Pomade</strong> (medium hold, natural finish): If you style your hair every day and want it to look intentional but not stiff. Apply to damp hair, work through with fingers, let air dry or blow dry on low heat.
