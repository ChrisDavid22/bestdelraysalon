                If you're reading this while holding a fistful of hair that just came out in the shower, I want you to know: <strong>this is completely normal</strong>. It's terrifying, yes. But it's not permanent, it's not a sign something is wrong, and it will get better.

                I'm writing this from <strong>Chris David Salon</strong> in Delray Beach (403 E Atlantic Ave), where we've worked with countless new mothers experiencing postpartum hair loss. I've heard the panic in your voice when you call asking if we can "do something." I've seen the tears when you sit in my chair explaining that you don't recognize your own hair anymore.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why This Is Happening (In Plain English)</h2>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                During pregnancy, elevated estrogen levels put more of your hair follicles into the "growing" phase and fewer into the "shedding" phase. This is why many women have amazing, thick hair during pregnancy—you're not growing more hair, you're just shedding less.

                    Your estrogen levels plummet. All that hair that SHOULD have been gradually shedding over the past 9 months suddenly shifts into the shedding phase at the same time. You're not losing MORE hair than normal—you're losing all the hair you DIDN'T lose during pregnancy, plus your regular shedding.

                <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
                    Normal shedding: 50-100 hairs/day<br>

                        You'll still lose more hair than pre-pregnancy, but it's decreasing. You might start seeing short "baby hairs" growing in around your hairline—this is regrowth starting.

                        Shedding should be back to pre-pregnancy levels. New growth becomes more visible (often creating a "halo" of short hairs around your face).

                I know right now it feels like your hair will never be the same. You're looking in the mirror at thinning patches, wondering if it'll grow back, feeling like one more thing about your body has changed without your permission.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Here's what I can tell you after helping hundreds of women through this: <strong>it grows back</strong>. Maybe not exactly the same—you might have more gray, or different texture, or slightly less density than before. But it grows back.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Give yourself grace. You grew a human. Your body is recovering from that. Hair loss is the least impressive thing your body has done recently.
