            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Walking into a salon for the first time can feel intimidating. There's an entire language you don't speak ("balayage," "ombré," "toner"), pricing that seems mysterious, and the nagging worry that you'll somehow mess up and end up with hair you hate.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                I've been styling hair in Delray Beach for over a decade, and I can tell you: <strong>good stylists WANT you to ask questions</strong>. We'd rather spend 15 minutes in consultation than 2 hours fixing a miscommunication. This guide will help you feel confident, prepared, and ensure you get exactly what you're hoping for.

                Not all salons are created equal, and expensive doesn't always mean better. Here's how to find a good match:

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What to Research Online</h3>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                        Don't just look at the star rating—read actual reviews. Look for:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="text-gray-700 space-y-2 text-sm">
                        <li>• <strong>Consistency:</strong> Are people happy with corrections when needed, or does the salon get defensive?</li>
                        <li>• <strong>Communication:</strong> Do reviews mention feeling heard and understood?</li>
                        <li>• <strong>Specific services:</strong> If you want color, look for reviews about color (not just cuts)</li>
                        <li>• <strong>Your hair type:</strong> Do people with similar hair texture/type have good experiences?</li>

                        Most salons post photos on Instagram or their website. You're not looking for artistic perfection—you're looking for styles similar to what you want. If every photo is editorial/fashion-forward and you want a natural, wearable cut, that's a mismatch.

                    In our area, you have excellent options across different price points and specialties. <strong>Salon Sora</strong> (4.9★, 400+ reviews) does beautiful editorial work. <strong>Rové</strong> has the volume to accommodate last-minute appointments. At <strong>Chris David Salon</strong> (403 E Atlantic Ave), we're the boutique option—smaller, more personalized, specializing in color and clients who want a relationship with their stylist rather than rotating through whoever's available.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                It happens. Maybe the cut is shorter than you wanted. Maybe the color didn't turn out as expected. Here's how to handle it:
            </p>

            <div class="space-y-6">
                <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Step 1: Speak Up (Immediately if Possible)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
                        If you notice something during your appointment—"This is shorter than I wanted" or "This color looks more orange than golden"—say so right away. It's easier to fix in real-time than after you've left.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Step 2: Give It 24-48 Hours (For Color)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
                        Hair color can look different once you wash and style it yourself. Most salons ask that you live with it for a day or two before requesting corrections. This is reasonable.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                        Most reputable salons will offer to fix issues for free within 1-2 weeks of your service. Be specific about what's wrong:
                    </p>

                        <li>• "The layers are shorter than the photo I showed you"</li>
                        <li>• "I'm experiencing significant breakage since my treatment"</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
                        Take photos of the issue. Keep your receipts. If the salon refuses to help or makes it worse, you have documentation for reviews or potential disputes.
                    </p>

            <p class="text-xl text-indigo-100 mb-8">
                We're a boutique salon (4.9★, 140+ reviews) at <strong>403 E Atlantic Ave</strong> in downtown Delray Beach. Here's what makes us different:

                    <p class="text-indigo-100 text-sm">
                        We don't rush this part. First-time clients get 15-20 minutes of dedicated consultation time before we even start. We want to understand your hair goals, lifestyle, and concerns.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p class="text-indigo-100 text-sm">
                        You'll know the cost before we start. No surprises at checkout. If additional services are needed mid-appointment, we discuss pricing before proceeding.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-indigo-100 text-sm">
                        We're small enough that you'll see the same stylist each visit. They'll remember your preferences, your hair history, and what worked last time.

                    <p class="text-indigo-100 text-sm">
                        If your inspiration photo isn't realistic for your hair type, we'll tell you. If you don't need an expensive treatment, we won't push it. Our reputation matters more than one upsell.

                    We're not the biggest salon in Delray Beach—that's <strong>Rové</strong> (5.0★, 1500+ reviews). We're not the trendiest—<strong>Salon Sora</strong> (4.9★, 400+ reviews) does amazing editorial work. But we ARE the salon where you won't feel like a number, where your stylist will remember your name and your last haircut, and where the goal is making you feel confident—not just getting you out the door.
